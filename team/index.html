<p>I’m a fourth year undergrad majoring in computer science. Outside of class, I’m also involved in ACM-W and volunteer with Doc Films, and in my free time I enjoy watching movies and doing puzzles! I have experience developing software with teams and really enjoy working with other people! I’m most comfortable working in Python and C, and also have some experience with front-end development.

<p>I’m a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in Linguistics and minoring in CS. Outside of class, I am on the women’s varsity lacrosse team and lead the Dirt Red Brass Band.  I like animals, art museums, and board games. I’ve studied American Sign Language for two years and have taken classes about/interacted with the American Deaf Community (and otherwise hearing impaired individuals).

<p>I’m a third-year undergrad majoring in Economics and CS. My hobbies include photography, traveling, and watching sports, and I’m interested in education, public transit, and design. I have experience with web development (mostly front end), mobile app development (React Native), and coding in JavaScript, Java, and C.

<p>I'm a third year powering through a late-declared CS major.  I'm into baking and hobby electronics—over the summer I made a remote controlled car out of a glasses case and some microchips.  I'm making my way through my fifth quarter of American Sign Language.  I have decent familiarity in Java and C, but I have a lot of experience with arduino/raspberry pi.
